    "## Astronaut Age\n",
    "During the Space Race, the first astronauts and cosmonauts were primarily drawn from the military and government sectors. Specifically, due to the highly experimental nature of early manned spaceflight, the first astronauts were almost exclusively test pilots from the armed forces, and as such were well into their military careers. Civilians were eventually drawn into the space program, typically highly degreed scientists as mission specialists. Currently, NASA maintains that Astronaut Candidates (ASCANs) must have at least a Master's degree in a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) field and extensive professional experience, or 1000 hours of pilot command time in jet aircraft. This tends to skew average astronaut ages at selection to early 30s, with crew selections set years in advance of mission launch to allow for adequate training and mission control experience. Thus, many astronauts are in their early 40s at mission launch. \n",
    "\n",
    "The youngest astronauts at time of selection were the Soviet cosmonauts **Pyotr Klimuk** , **Gennady Sarafanov** and **Vyacheslav Zudov,** who were each 23 years old. The youngest humans to achieve spaceflight were Soviet cosmonauts **Gherman Titov** and **Valentina Tereshkova**, each at 26 years old. 32 year old **Sally Ride** is the youngest American to achieve spaceflight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private citizen **Dennis Tito** at 60 years old currently holds the record for oldest astronaut at selection, while American career astronaut **John Glenn** is the oldest astronaut at time of launch at 77 years old*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<sub><sup>As of 2022, 90-year old actor William Shatner surpassed John Glenn as the oldest human in space with Blue Origin. As mentioned previously, this is beyond the scope of the dataset</sup></sub>"
